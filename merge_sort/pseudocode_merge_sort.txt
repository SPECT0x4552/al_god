- Recursively sort 1st half of the input aray
- "     "   2nd "     "
- merge two sorted sublists into one

C - output array(length = n)
A = 1st sorted array
B = 2nd sorted array

i = 1 (index of first element in A)
j = 1 (index of first element in B)


-------

for k = 1 to n
	if(A[i] < B[j]) 
		c[k] = A[i]
